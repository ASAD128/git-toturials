Architecture
Repository
Staging index (git commit go repository)
Working directory (git add go staging)

Head is a pointer reisdes at the tip of current branch

git diff (working and repository)
git diff --staged (staging and repositoy)

git reset or git reset HEAD -- filename.txt
git mv first.txt second.txt

Git diff color--words first.txt

git commit -am "Message" be very carefull while using -a it add and commit in one line but didn't care about new and deleted file

Undo
Undo Git Changes working directory
git checkout delete.txt undo changes in working directory and make it similar like repository
Undo Git Changes staging
git reset HEAD filename.txt

git revert to previous commit


if we want to reset or rollback to 2 or 3 commit before use git reset
git reset --soft 4b039a99ce0 (Only remove from repository)
git reset --mixed (Remove changes from staging, make repo and staging similar but still have changed file inside working directory)
git reset --hard (Very weird delete every thing from working directory, staging, repo to previous commit)

To remove untracked file
git clean -n 
git clean -f
